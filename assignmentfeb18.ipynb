    "REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services.\n",

    "#Question5:\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Difference between REST and SOAP:\n",
    "1.Architecture:\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer): REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n",
    "to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.\n",
    "It treats every piece of information as a resource and is stateless, meaning the server does not store any client state between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.\n",
    "It uses XML as the message format and can work with various transport protocols like HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.\n",
    "SOAP messages are stateful, maintaining information between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Message Format:\n",
    "REST: RESTful APIs commonly use lightweight data interchange formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) \n",
    "or XML to represent data in the request and response messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP messages are typically in XML format, making them self-descriptive and platform-independent\n",
    "but resulting in larger and more complex messages compared to JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Usage:\n",
    "REST: RESTful APIs are commonly used for web-based applications and services, and they are well-suited for\n",
    "lightweight, mobile, and browser-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP is often used in enterprise-level applications, particularly in situations where the WS-* standards\n",
    "and features like security and transaction support are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Performance:\n",
    "REST: Due to its lightweight nature and use of efficient data formats like JSON, RESTful APIs\n",
    "generally have better performance, especially in high-latency or low-bandwidth environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP messages can be bulkier and more complex due to XML, leading to higher bandwidth usage\n",
    "and potential performance overhead."
